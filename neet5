You are given an array of characters which represents a string s. Write a function which reverses a string.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Input: s = ["n","e","e","t"]

Output: ["t","e","e","n"]


def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """

        return s.reverse()
