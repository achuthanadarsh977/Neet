Given an array of strings strs, group all anagrams together into sublists. You may return the output in any order.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["act","pots","tops","cat","stop","hat"]

Output: [["hat"],["act", "cat"],["stop", "pots", "tops"]]

from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
         
         ana = defaultdict(list)

         for word in strs:
            key = ''.join(sorted(word))
            ana[key].append(word)

         return list(ana.values())
