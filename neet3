Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        m = {}
        for i,n in enumerate(nums):
            d = target - n
            if d in m:
                return [m[d],i]
            m[n] = i
