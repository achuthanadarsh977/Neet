Given the beginning of a singly linked list head, reverse the list, and return the new beginning of the list.

eg: Input: head = [0,1,2,3]

Output: [3,2,1,0]

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

       prev , curr = None , head

       while curr:
           temp = curr.next
           curr.next = prev
           prev = curr
           curr = temp
       return prev
