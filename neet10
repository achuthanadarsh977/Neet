ou are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

Given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

An integer x: Record a new score of x.
'+': Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
'D': Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
'C': Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.
Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.

Note: The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a 32-bit integer and that all operations are valid.

class Solution:
    def calPoints(self, operations: List[str]) -> int:
        s = []
        for op in operations:

            if op == "+":
                s.append(s[-1]+s[-2])
            elif op == "D":
                s.append(2*s[-1])
            elif op == "C":
                s.pop()
            else:
                s.append(int(op))

        return sum(s)
