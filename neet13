ou are given an integer array nums and an integer val. Your task is to remove all occurrences of val from nums in-place.

After removing all occurrences of val, return the number of remaining elements, say k, such that the first k elements of nums do not contain val.

Note:

The order of the elements which are not equal to val does not matter.
It is not necessary to consider elements beyond the first k positions of the array.
To be accepted, the first k elements of nums must contain only elements not equal to val.
Return k as the final result.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,4], val = 1

Output: [2,3,4]

class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:

        left = 0
        right = len(nums)

        while left < right:

            if nums[left] == val:
                right-=1
                nums[left] = nums[right]

            else:
                left+=1

        return right
